Block New Resources for Moodle
==============================

---------
The block
---------
This block displays to the students a list of newly published resources from all courses in which they are enrolled. The idea is to create a way for the student to follow the updates without having to access all courses. 

-------------------
The advanced search
-------------------
The block also has an advanced search interface that allows students to perform searches in the newly published resources using filters such as date, course and resource name.

---------------
The email alert
---------------
It is possible to configure a periodic email alert that is sent to students notifying them about new features published.

--------------
Special thanks
